Hu?

Ever been in a team where the build broke and no one noticed for an hour, or perhaps you hadn't realised how much time had been consumed from a project budget? I've been there and I believe that had I known sooner; I could have been proactive enough to avoid the issues it caused.

What The?
---------
Here's the thing, committing broken work can be avoided by dilligence, process, procedure or tooling. However, it's still going to happen occasionally, a wall board gives you a window into the results of your continuious integration and time keeping software and will happily run on an old computer with a 20" monitor in the corner.

Okay, but I don't use Harvest/TeamCity

Hopefully you either are a programmer or know some programmers, if you don't I would love to know why how and why you are using this. Please feel free to take a fork of the project then send through a pull request if it works and fits with the architecture then I will include the changes. Don't forget to update humans.txt to include your name and relevant details.
